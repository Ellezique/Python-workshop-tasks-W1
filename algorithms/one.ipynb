    "- `push(item)` - Add new item to top of stack. Requires item. Returns nothing. Time Complexity: O(1)\n",

Here it will be used to return the item with the max value in the stack. The brute force method will push elements to the stack and the complexity of max() will be O(n) because it must, in a worst case scenario, iterate through each item in the list i.e. the complexity will increase in direct proportion to the number of items in the stack. An example of this has been commented out of the first code example, above. \n",

An auxiliary stack is helper data structure that will take up additional space for the time that it is stored. The time complexity is 0(1) but the auxiliary complexity is O(n) i.e. complexity is constant and auxiliary complexity is linear (increases directly proportional to the stack size).\n",
